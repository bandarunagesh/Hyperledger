Fabri SDK preparation:

SDK Does have below files to be configured:
	app.js
	config.js
	package.json
	
Let's talk about config.js
	1. it defines the things to run 'fabric-client' and the required parameters/values
	2. we should be having the 'fabric-client' in node_modules
	3. it uses network_config.yml to check the different details like endorsment peer etc.
	
	setConfigSetting:
		this setting is used to pass diffrent files required to operate fabric client, like 'netowrk_config.yml', 'org1.yaml', 'org2.yaml'
	
	addConfigFile:
		we need to override the default setting of the client by providng the current 'config.js' file location, so fabric client uses this cofiguration and ignore defult one.
