The first time you start up a new runtime, you'll need to run the start script, then generate a PeerAdmin card:

PeerAdmincard: PeerAdmin@hlfv1
business network definition (BND)
data model, transaction logic and access control rules
Yeoman generator to create a skeleton business network
.cto -  class definitions for all assets, participants, and transactions
permissions.acl - basic access control rules
logic.js -  transaction processor functions
package.json - business network metadata

Hyperledger Composer Modelling Language

packaged into a deployable business network archive (.bna) 
business network can be deployed to the instance of Hyperledger Fabric
nstall chaincode to the peer as well as start chaincode on the composerchannel channel

Steps:
Hyperledger Composer business network to be installed on the peer
business network can be started
new participant, identity, and associated card must be created to be the network administrator
network administrator business network card must be imported for use
network can then be pinged 


Hyperledger Composer can generate a bespoke REST API based on a business network
 generate an Angular 4 application running against the REST API
