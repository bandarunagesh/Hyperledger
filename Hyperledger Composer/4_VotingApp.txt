1. Clear existing memory details
cd fabric-dev-servers/
sudo ./teardownFabric.sh
sudo ./teardownFabric.sh
sudo ./teardownAllDocker.sh

When prompted select option 1

1. Create project
yo hyperledger-composer:businessnetwork

2. If you see you not found then run below steps
npm cache clean
sudo npm rm -g yo
npm cache clean
sudo npm install -g yo

3. Make the destination directory writable by yo
sudo chmod -R 777 .
sudo chmod -R 777 . ~

3. You will ask steps, enter below
############################
Business network name: votingapp
Description: My first network
Author: Your Name
Author email: your email
License: Press Enter
Namespace: org.example.voting
Do you want to generate an empty template network? select No

############################

4. You should see below results:
 create package.json
   create README.md
   create models/org.example.mynetwork.cto
   create permissions.acl
   create .eslintrc.yml
   create features/sample.feature
   create features/support/index.js
   create test/logic.js
   create lib/logic.js

5. Explanation of the files

A business network is made up of assets, participants, transactions, access control rules, and optionally events and queries. In the skeleton business network created in the previous steps, there is a model (.cto) file which will contain the class definitions for all assets, participants, and transactions in the business network. The skeleton business network also contains an access control (permissions.acl) document with basic access control rules, a script (logic.js) file containing transaction processor functions, and a package.json file containing business network metadata.

6. Open the '/tutorial-network/models/org.example.mynetwork.cto' model file.
nano ./tutorial-network/models/org.example.mynetwork.cto

Clear the content and update below:

/*
  Write your model definitions here
 */
namespace org.example.voting

participant voter identified by voterID {
  o String voterID
  o String fullName
}

asset ifVoted identified by voterID {
  o String voterID
  o Boolean votedOrNot
}

asset candidateVote identified by politicalParty {
  o String politicalParty
  o Integer totalVote
}
transaction vote {
  --> candidateVote candidateVoteAsset
  --> ifVoted ifVotedAsset
}


7. Adding JavaScript transaction logic by opening the file './tutorial-network/lib/logic.js'
nano ./tutorial-network/lib/logic.js
clear the content and update with below:

/**
 * Track the trade of a commodity from one trader to another
 * @param {org.example.mynetwork.Trade} trade - the trade to be processed
 * @transaction
 */
async function tradeCommodity(trade) {
    trade.commodity.owner = trade.newOwner;
    let assetRegistry = await getAssetRegistry('org.example.mynetwork.Commodity');
    await assetRegistry.update(trade.commodity);
}

8. Adding access control by opening the file './tutorial-network/permissions.acl'

nano ./tutorial-network/permissions.acl

clear the content and update with below:

/**
 * Access control rules for tutorial-network
 */
rule Default {
    description: "Allow all participants access to all resources"
    participant: "ANY"
    operation: ALL
    resource: "org.example.mynetwork.*"
    action: ALLOW
}

rule SystemACL {
  description:  "System ACL to permit all access"
  participant: "ANY"
  operation: ALL
  resource: "org.hyperledger.composer.system.**"
  action: ALLOW
}

9. Generate a business network archive
From the tutorial-network directory, run the following command:
cd tutorial-network/
composer archive create -t dir -n .

10. After the command has run, a business network archive file called tutorial-network@0.0.1.bna has been created in the tutorial-network directory. check by running below command
ls -l 

10A. Incase if you see any isses with installations need to run with sudo

11. Run the below commands:

../fabric-dev-servers/startFabric.sh
../fabric-dev-servers/createPeerAdminCard.sh

12. Deploy the business network
composer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile votingapp@0.0.1.bna

13. Start the business network
composer network start --networkName votingapp --networkVersion 0.0.1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file networkadmin.card

14. Import network admin card
composer card import --file networkadmin.card

16. Verification of business network deployment
composer network ping --card admin@votingapp

17. run the composer playground
composer-playground
 
18. You can now go to 'http://localhost:8080' and see the tutorial-network is created

19. Generating a REST server
composer-rest-server

20 . It will ask few questions, answer carefully
Enter the name of the business network card to use: admin@votingapp
Specfiy if you want to use namespace in the generated REST API: nerver use namespaces
Specfiy if you want to use an API key to secure the REST API: N
Specfiy if you want to enable authentication for the REST API using Passport: N
Specfiy if you want to enable the explorer test interface: Y
Specfiy a key if you want to enable dynamic logging: <just press enter>
Specfiy if you want to enable event publication over WebSockets: Y
Specfiy if you want to enable TLS security for the REST API: N

21. Now you can access the composer API though 'http://localhost:3000'

22. Generating an application
yo hyperledger-composer:angular

23. Answer below question when asked

do you want to connect a running business network: Y
Project Name: <Name of the application>
Description: <any description>
Author Name: <Your Name>
Author email: <Your email>
License: <Click Enter>
Name of the business card: admin@tutorial-network
Do you want to generate a new REST API or connect to an existing REST API? Connect to an existing REST API
Rest Server Address: http://localhost
Rest Server Port: 3000
Should namespace be used in the generated REST API? Namespace are not used


24. Go to angular project directory created i.e 'angular-app'
cd angular-app

25. run below command to start application
npm start

26. Now you should see an message saying server running in 'http:\\0.0.0.0:4200'
Go to Ubuntu and Open the 'http:\\localhost:4200'
