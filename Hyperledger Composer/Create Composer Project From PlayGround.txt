How to create project in Composer
Step One: Open the Hyperledger Composer Playground
Step Two: Creating a new business network

1. Click Deploy a new business network under the Web Browser heading to get started.

2. The new business network needs a name, let's call it tutorial-network.

3. Optionally, you can enter a description for your business network.

4. Next we must select a business network to base ours on, because we want to build the network from scratch, click empty-business-network.

5. Now that our network is defined, click Deploy.

Step Three: Connecting to the business network

To connect to our business network click Connect now under our business network card.

Step Four: Adding a model file
Click on 'Model File' (models/sample.cto) and replace with below content:

/**
 * My commodity trading network
 */
namespace org.example.mynetwork
asset Commodity identified by tradingSymbol {
    o String tradingSymbol
    o String description
    o String mainExchange
    o Double quantity
    --> Trader owner
}
participant Trader identified by tradeId {
    o String tradeId
    o String firstName
    o String lastName
}
transaction Trade {
    --> Commodity commodity
    --> Trader newOwner
}


Step Five: Adding a transaction processor script file
Click on 'Script file' (lib/sample.js) and replace with below content:

/**
 * Track the trade of a commodity from one trader to another
 * @param {org.example.mynetwork.Trade} trade - the trade to be processed
 * @transaction
 */
async function tradeCommodity(trade) {
    trade.commodity.owner = trade.newOwner;
    let assetRegistry = await getAssetRegistry('org.example.mynetwork.Commodity');
    await assetRegistry.update(trade.commodity);
}



Step Six: Adding a Access Control file
Clear the content in ACL (permissions.acl) and update below content


/**
 * Sample access control list.
 */
rule EverybodyCanReadEverything {
    description: "Allow all participants read access to all resources"
    participant: "org.example.mynetwork.Trader"
    operation: READ
    resource: "org.example.mynetwork.*"
    action: ALLOW
}

rule EverybodyCanSubmitTransactions {
    description: "Allow all participants to submit transactions"
    participant: "org.example.mynetwork.Trader"
    operation: CREATE
    resource: "org.example.mynetwork.Commodity"
    action: ALLOW
}

rule OwnerHasFullAccessToTheirAssets {
    description: "Allow all participants full access to their assets"
    participant(p): "org.example.mynetwork.Trader"
    operation: ALL
    resource(r): "org.example.mynetwork.Commodity"
    condition: (r.owner.getIdentifier() === p.getIdentifier())
    action: ALLOW
}

rule SystemACL {
    description: "System ACL to permit all access"
    participant: "org.hyperledger.composer.system.Participant"
    operation: ALL
    resource: "org.hyperledger.composer.system.**"
    action: ALLOW
}

rule NetworkAdminUser {
    description: "Grant business network administrators full access to user resources"
    participant: "org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin"
    operation: ALL
    resource: "**"
    action: ALLOW
}

rule NetworkAdminSystem {
    description: "Grant business network administrators full access to system resources"
    participant: "org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin"
    operation: ALL
    resource: "org.hyperledger.composer.system.**"
    action: ALLOW
}


Step Seven: Deploying the updated business network
Click Deploy changes to upgrade the business network.

Step Eight: Testing the business network definition

Step Nine: Creating participants

1. Ensure that you have the Trader tab selected on the left, and click Create New Participant in the upper right.

{
  "$class": "org.example.mynetwork.Trader",
  "tradeId": "TRADER1",
  "firstName": "Jenny",
  "lastName": "Jones"
}


{
  "$class": "org.example.mynetwork.Trader",
  "tradeId": "TRADER2",
  "firstName": "Amy",
  "lastName": "Williams"
}

Step Ten: Creating an asset

Click the Commodity tab under Assets and click Create New Asset.

{
  "$class": "org.example.mynetwork.Commodity",
  "tradingSymbol": "ABC",
  "description": "Test commodity",
  "mainExchange": "Euronext",
  "quantity": 72.297,
  "owner": "resource:org.example.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER1"
}

Step Eleven: Transferring the commodity between the participants
Click the Submit Transaction button on the left.

{
  "$class": "org.example.mynetwork.Trade",
  "commodity": "resource:org.example.mynetwork.Commodity#ABC",
  "newOwner": "resource:org.example.mynetwork.Trader#TRADER2"
}
