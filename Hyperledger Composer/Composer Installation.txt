**If installing Hyperledger Composer using Linux, be aware of the following advice:

Login as a normal user, rather than root.
Do not su to root.
When installing prerequisites, use curl, then unzip using sudo.
Run prereqs-ubuntu.sh as a normal user. It may prompt for root password as some of it's actions are required to be run as root.
Do not use npm with sudo or su to root to use it.
Avoid installing node globally as root.**
